## Introduction

The Audiophile Front-end Challenge is designed to assess our ability to create a visually appealing and functional website for the audiophile e-commerce store. By completing this competition, I had the opportunity to showcase my React.js, Styled Component skills, as well as your understanding of responsive design principles and user experience.

## Challenge

The challenge is to create a responsive website for an audiophile store based on the provided design files. The design files contain the desktop and mobile versions along with the design features and assets.

Our task is to implement the design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and make the website fully responsive on different screen sizes. The website must accurately represent the design provided, including interactive elements, product listings, and cart functionality.

For detailed instructions and design files, please refer to the [Challenge Folder](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/audiophile-app-with-reactjs-8n1_joZFKB) within this repository.
